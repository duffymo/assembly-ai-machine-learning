Random Useful Notes

* I was saved by a [Stack Overflow answer](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64735788/clear-git-commits-before-push__;!!NT4GcUJTZV9haA!tQIuUZTLo_aSMuRHQFxSbvf3BQqK4cLCZM5bM6UAignV9iHm2kdUcFG2Dxi3_u1ZTGmSH_Nc9atNQ4fE$ ) from another GitHub fiasco.  Thank goodness for this command: 

```
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

* Today I learned [what np.reshape(-1, 1) means](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57962718/reshaping-data-in-numpy-with-1-1-what-does-it-mean): It flattens any array of values into a row vector and transposes it into a column vector.
